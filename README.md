## Volcano Plots

Volcano plots are a powerful tool commonly used in genomics to identify significant changes in datasets that involve multiple comparisons. The plot itself displays **log fold changes** on the x-axis and **negative log10 p-values** on the y-axis, making it easier to distinguish between changes that are both statistically significant and biologically meaningful.

The "volcano" shape, with its wide base and narrowing peak, highlights data points that stand out as statistically significant, allowing researchers to quickly identify candidates for further study.

### Key Features:
- **X-axis**: Represents the log fold changes.
- **Y-axis**: Represents the negative log10 p-values.
- **Shape**: The "volcano" shape emphasizes statistically significant data points.

Volcano plots are particularly useful for visualizing large datasets and pinpointing changes that warrant further investigation in a clear and concise manner.

Beyond genomics, volcano plots are also utilized in drug discovery, proteomics, and other fields where large-scale data sets require careful analysis to pinpoint relevant findings. They help in identifying outliers and patterns that may indicate important biological phenomena, making them a staple in exploratory data analysis for complex biological data. Using Python and Plotly, these plots can be customized and made interactive, providing a dynamic way to explore and communicate findings.
